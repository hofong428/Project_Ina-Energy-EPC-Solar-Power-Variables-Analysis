Analysis of solar irridiance, temprature, atmosphere, humidity and Power correlation 
## EPC solar stations data analytics
EPC in the solar industry means engineering, procurement, and construction. It is a term that is widely used by companies that provide end-to-end solar energy services, including designing the system, giving procurement details about the system, and installing it. After delivering the functional solar system to you, solar EPC companies continue to perform regular checks and continuous maintenance to ensure your solar system works at optimum efficiency.

### **Breaking Down the Solar EPC Company**  
Ina Energy Corporation(https://www.inaenergy.com.tw/) is an EPC company using state of the art technology. Their business processes involved:

**Engineering**  
Design booster stations, heavy power projects, distribution lines, etc.
- Analyze the clientâ€™s requirements and the proposed solar system
- Perform a site survey to check the viability of the solar system
- Monitor the prevailing weather conditions
- Determine the best structural design and maximum power generation capacity
- Selecting the equipment to use and making a 3D model of the solar system

**Procurement**  
Negotiate with the major manufacturers to lock in competitive pricing and comprehensive warranty terms. 

**Construction**  
This is the last stage of the process, the activity involves mounting the solar panels, accessories, and installing grid connectivity along with solar implementation in line with your existing power supply system. After installation, the solar EPC company will offer after-sale services like maintaining system through equipment monitoring and maintenance.

It is expected that the installation capacity will reach 300MW within 3 years, and develop to 500MW within 5 years.
